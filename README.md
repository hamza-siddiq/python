# python

You'll find the projects Python Projects that I have worked on here.

Hog:
• Developed a dice game, where two players took turns in order to reach the maximum score of 100. Some rules
that were added included:

• Sow Sad: If the dice outcome was 1, the players score for the turn was 1.
• Picky Piggy: A player that chose to roll zero fices scored the nth digit of the decimal expansion of 1/7 (0.14285714...) where n was the opponent’s score. If n was 0, the opponent got 7 points.
• Hog Pile: If the players scores were the same after scores were added, the current players score double.


Cats :
• Developed a project that measured typing speed, and implemented typing autocorrect.
• Made extensive use of control Statements, higher order functions, environment diagrams, recursion, containers, sequences, data abstraction, tree recursion, iterators, inheritance etc.
